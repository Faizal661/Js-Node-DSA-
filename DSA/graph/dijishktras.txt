**Dijkstra's Algorithm**

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, particularly in weighted graphs where each edge has a numerical weight assigned to it. It's named after its creator, Edsger W. Dijkstra, who conceived it in 1956 and published it three years later.

**Key Concepts**

* **Weighted Graph:** A graph where each edge has a numerical weight associated with it, representing the cost or distance of traversing that edge.
* **Shortest Path:** The path between two nodes in a graph with the minimum total weight of its edges.
* **Greedy Approach:** Dijkstra's algorithm employs a greedy approach, meaning it makes the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that this will lead to the globally optimal solution.

**How it Works**

1. **Initialization:**
   * Set the distance to the source node as 0.
   * Set the distance to all other nodes as infinity.
   * Create a set of unvisited nodes.

2. **Iteration:**
   * Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the source node.
   * Mark the selected node as visited.
   * For each unvisited neighbor of the selected node:
     * Calculate the tentative distance from the source node through the selected node.
     * If the tentative distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance.

3. **Termination:**
   * Repeat step 2 until all nodes have been visited.

**Applications**

* **Routing protocols:** Finding the shortest paths in networks like the internet.
* **GPS navigation:** Calculating the shortest routes between locations.
* **Transportation planning:** Optimizing routes for public transportation or delivery services.
* **Network analysis:** Identifying critical paths in networks.

**Time Complexity**

* **Adjacency matrix representation:** O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices.
* **Adjacency list representation:** O((V + E) log V), where E is the number of edges.

**Important Note:**

Dijkstra's algorithm works correctly only for graphs with non-negative edge weights. If there are negative weights, other algorithms like Bellman-Ford or A* search can be used.
