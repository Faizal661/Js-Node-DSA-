Redux Saga is a library that simplifies the management of side effects in Redux applications, particularly those involving asynchronous operations like data fetching or API calls. It allows you to write generator functions (sagas) that handle these actions separately from the Redux reducer functions, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

For example, consider a scenario where you want to fetch data from a server after a user action. You would define a saga like this:

import { takeEvery, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

export function* fetchData() {
  try {
    // Call the API and get the data
    const data = yield call(fetchApi);
    
    // Dispatch an action to update the store with the data
    yield put({ type: 'DATA_RECEIVED', payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error here
  }
}

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield takeEvery('FETCH_DATA', fetchData);
}
In this example, the fetchData saga is triggered whenever the FETCH_DATA action is dispatched. It makes the API call, handles any errors, and then dispatches another action to update the Redux store with the fetched data.
